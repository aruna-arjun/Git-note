**Git:**
- Git is a distributed version control system.
- It allows developers to track changes in source code during software development.

**Git Commands:**

1. **git init:** Initializes a new Git repository.
   
2. **git clone [URL]:** Clones a repository from a remote source  
   (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/aruna-arjun/git-note.git`).

3. **git add [file]:** Adds files to the staging area.  
   (e.g., `git add index.html` or `git add .`)

4. **git commit -m "message":** Commits changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.  
   (e.g., `git commit -m "Added new feature to index.html"`)

5. **git status:** Shows the status of the working directory and staging area.

6. **git push:** Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.  
   (e.g., `git push origin main`)

7. **git pull:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them.  
   (e.g., `git pull origin main`)

8. **git branch:** Lists, creates, or deletes branches.  
   (e.g., `git branch feature-branch`)

9. **git merge [branch]:** Merges a specified branch into the current branch.  
   (e.g., `git merge feature-branch`)

10. **git status:** Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.  
    (e.g., `git status`)

11. **git log:** Shows a list of all commits made in the repository, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.  
    (e.g., `git log`)

12. **git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>:**  
    Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository to the current branch. It combines `git fetch` and `git merge`.  
    (e.g., `git pull origin main`)
