Git and GitHub are essential tools for version control and collaboration in software development. Here's a brief overview of both:

Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Some key features of Git include:

Version Control: Git keeps a record of all changes made to files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
Branching and Merging: You can create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently and merge them back into the main codebase.
Distributed System: Every developer has a local copy of the entire project history, which enables offline work and independent code contributions.
Commit History: Each change (commit) is logged, showing who made the changes and when. This helps in tracking the progress and debugging issues.
Staging Area: Changes can be added to a staging area before committing, allowing for better control over what changes are included in a commit.
Basic Git Commands
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git clone [URL]: Clones a repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub).
git add [file]: Adds files to the staging area.
git commit -m "message": Commits changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.
git status: Shows the status of the working directory and staging area.
git push: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them.
git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
git merge [branch]: Merges a specified branch into the current branch.gi
